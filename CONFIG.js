I have a confession to make.

When I started planning this Valentine's week, I realized something that made me feel both silly and incredibly grateful.

I didn't know about Rose Day, Propose Day, Chocolate Day, Teddy Day, Promise Day, Hug Day, or Kiss Day.

All I knew was Valentine's Day - because that's the day everyone talks about. But in learning about these days, I discovered something beautiful: each one represents a different way to show love.

And that's when it hit me - I've been celebrating these with you every day without even knowing their names.

Every time I bring you flowers "just because" - that was Rose Day.
Every time I promise to be there for you - that was Promise Day.
Every hug, every kiss, every sweet moment... we've been living this week all year round.

So this isn't just me learning about Valentine's week. This is me realizing how many ways there are to love you, and how I want to celebrate each one intentionally.

I'm sorry I didn't know about these days earlier, but I'm not sorry for how we've been loving each other. We were ahead of the game.

This website is my promise to celebrate every single way I love you - not just on special days, but every day.

Thank you for being my constant Rose, my sweet Chocolate, my comforting Teddy, my Promise, my Hug, my Kiss, and my Valentine - every single day.

Forever yours,
[YOUR_NAME]`
